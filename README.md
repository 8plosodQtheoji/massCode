## Supporting

The best support right now is your star for the project. You can also help spread the word about the app in the public.

## Feature for now
- Support M1
- Syntax highlighting over 170 languages
- API to fetch snippets on the localhost

## Overview

The goal of creating this application was mostly my own growth as a developer. Also, I wanted this project to absorb the best of such applications already on the market (both free and paid). At the same time, I wanted this project to be an open source project.

massCode allows you to organize snippets using multi-level folders as well as tags. Each snippet has fragments - tabs, which gives even greater level of organization.
