> "I've been following Marc's tutorials for a long time and I can say that he is one of the best teachers out there. He knows how to break down complex concepts into simple steps and make them easy to understand. His ART School course is amazing and I learned so much from it. Term 2 was especially useful for me because I always struggled with anatomy and perspective. Now I feel more confident and motivated to create better art."
