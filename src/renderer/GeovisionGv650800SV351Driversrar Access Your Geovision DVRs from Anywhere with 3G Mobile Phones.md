3. Troubleshoot common problems with Geovision card
 
Here are some of the common problems that you may encounter when using your Geovision card and how to fix them:

- No video signal on some or all channels: Check if the cameras are connected properly to the card and receiving power. Make sure the video format (NTSC or PAL) matches the card's setting. Try swapping the cameras or cables to see if the problem persists. If the problem is with the card, you may need to contact technical support or replace the card.
- Video quality is poor or distorted: Adjust the video settings on Geovision software, such as brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, etc. Make sure the cameras are compatible with the card and have good resolution. Avoid using long or low-quality cables that may cause signal loss or interference. Use a video amplifier or balun if needed.
- Audio is not working or noisy: Check if the audio source is connected properly to the card and receiving power. Make sure the audio format (mono or stereo) matches the card's setting. Adjust the audio settings on Geovision software, such as volume, gain, etc. Avoid using long or low-quality cables that may cause signal loss or interference. Use an audio amplifier or filter if needed.
- Recording is not working or incomplete: Check if the hard drive has enough space and is not corrupted. Make sure the recording schedule and mode are set up correctly on Geovision software. Check if the motion detection or alarm settings are working properly. Try to format or defragment the hard drive if needed.
- Remote access is not working or slow: Check if the network settings are correct on Geovision software and your router. Make sure you have a valid IP address and port number for your Geovision system. Forward the port on your router if needed. Use a dynamic DNS service if your IP address changes frequently. Check your internet speed and bandwidth usage. Avoid using wireless connections or VPNs that may cause latency or instability.
