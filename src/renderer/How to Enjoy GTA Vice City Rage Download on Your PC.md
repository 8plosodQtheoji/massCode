GTA Vice City is one of the most beloved games in the Grand Theft Auto series, but it has not received an official remaster or remake from Rockstar Games. However, some fans have taken matters into their own hands and created GTA Vice City Rage, a mod that ports the game to the RAGE engine used by GTA IV and GTA V.

GTA Vice City Rage is a testament to the passion and creativity of the GTA fan community. It is a tribute to one of the most iconic games of all time. If you are a fan of GTA Vice City, you may want to give it a try.
  
Before you download GTA Vice City Rage, you should check if your PC meets the system requirements for the mod. Since the mod uses the RAGE engine, it is more demanding than the original game. You will need at least a dual-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with 256 MB of video memory and DirectX 9.0 support . For optimal performance, you may want to have a quad-core processor, 16 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with 4 GB of video memory and DirectX 11 support [^2^]. You can use a system checker tool to see if your PC can run GTA Vice City Rage.
 
Another thing to consider before downloading GTA Vice City Rage is that the mod is still in development and not finished yet. The current version of the mod is beta 4, which was released in 2015. It only has a few missions available and some features are missing or incomplete. The developers are working on a new version called GTA Vice City 2, which will have more content and improvements. However, there is no official release date for GTA Vice City 2 yet. You can follow the progress of the mod on its official website or social media pages.
 
GTA Vice City Rage is not the only mod that aims to bring GTA Vice City to a modern engine. There are other projects, such as GTA Vice Cry Remastered, GTA Vice City Stories PC Edition, and GTA Underground. These mods have different goals and features, but they all share a common love for GTA Vice City and its nostalgic atmosphere.
