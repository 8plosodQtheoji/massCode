# How to create PBR materials from a single image with Substance B2M3
 
Substance B2M3 is a powerful tool that allows you to generate realistic and high-quality PBR materials from a single diffuse image. PBR stands for Physically Based Rendering, which is a technique that simulates how light interacts with different materials in a realistic way. PBR materials consist of several maps, such as base color, normal, roughness, metallic, ambient occlusion, and height, that define the appearance and behavior of the surface.

With Substance B2M3, you can easily create these maps from any image, such as a photo or a painting, and customize them with various parameters and filters. You can also preview your material in different lighting and rendering environments, and export it to use in your favorite 3D software or game engine.
 
Substance B2M3 can be used in two ways: as a standalone application or as a plugin for Substance compatible tools, such as 3ds Max, Maya, Unity, Unreal Engine, and more. In this article, we will show you how to use Substance B2M3 as a standalone application and create a PBR material from scratch.

## Step 1: Load your image
 
To start using Substance B2M3, you need to load an image that you want to convert into a material. The image should be a power of 2 square (for example, 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels) for optimal results. If your image is not a power of 2 square, Substance B2M3 will resize it automatically.
 
To load your image, simply drag and drop it into the Substance B2M3 window or click on the "Load Image" button at the top left corner. You will see your image displayed in the 2D view on the left side of the window.
 
## Step 2: Generate your maps
 
Once you have loaded your image, Substance B2M3 will automatically generate the base color map and the normal map for your material. The base color map is the main color information of your material, while the normal map is a special map that adds detail and depth to your surface by simulating small bumps and grooves.
 
You can see these maps in the 3D view on the right side of the window, where you can also rotate and zoom the camera to inspect your material from different angles. You can also change the lighting and rendering settings by clicking on the icons at the top right corner of the 3D view.
 
To generate more maps for your material, such as roughness, metallic, ambient occlusion, and height, you need to click on the "Generate All Maps" button at the bottom left corner of the window. This will launch a process that analyzes your image and creates the additional maps based on its features.
 
The roughness map defines how smooth or rough your surface is, which affects how it reflects light. The metallic map defines how metallic or non-metallic your surface is, which affects how it reacts to light. The ambient occlusion map defines how much ambient light reaches different parts of your surface, which affects how dark or bright they appear. The height map defines how high or low different parts of your surface are relative to each other, which affects how they cast shadows and occlude each other.
 
## Step 3: Customize your maps
 
After generating all the maps for your material, you can customize them with various parameters and filters to achieve the desired look. You can access these options by clicking on the tabs at the bottom right corner of the window.
 
The "Global Parameters" tab allows you to adjust some global settings for your material, such as contrast, saturation, hue shift, intensity balance, tiling mode, output size, and more. You can also enable or disable some features such as grunge maps (which add dirt and wear to your material), fine details (which add high-frequency details to your normal map), curvature (which adds edge highlights to your material), and more.
 
The "Base Parameters" tab allows you to adjust some specific settings for each map of your material, such as intensity, contrast, blur, invert, levels, noise removal, edge detection, and more
