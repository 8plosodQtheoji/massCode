The game is a sequel to 2010's Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, although Spider-Man Noir and Ultimate Spider-Man are not featured, only mentioned. The game's gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, with players able to web swing, web zip, crawl walls, and use the 'spider-sense' to identify enemies or objects of interest. Both Spider-Men have a new exclusive ability: the original Spider-Man has a "hyper-sense" mode, allowing him to move quickly and pulverize enemies; Spider-Man 2099 can create a fake simulation of himself to divert an enemy or to move to another area unharmed.
 
The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the voice acting, graphics, and story, but criticized the linear gameplay, repetitive combat, and lack of replay value. The game was also de-listed and removed from all digital storefronts on January 1, 2014, along with most other games published by Activision that had used the Marvel license.

The game's main feature is the "cause-and-effect" system, in which the actions of one Spider-Man will affect the other and vice versa. For example, destroying a generator in the present will cause a building to collapse in the future, creating a new path for Spider-Man 2099. The two Spider-Men can also communicate with each other through the chronal link, giving each other hints, warnings, or jokes. The game also features various challenges and side missions that can be completed for extra XP and costumes.

The game's graphics and voice acting were praised by critics, who noted the improvement over Shattered Dimensions. The game features Josh Keaton as the voice of Spider-Man 2099 and Christopher Daniel Barnes as the voice of Spider-Man, both reprising their roles from Shattered Dimensions. The game also features Steve Blum as Anti-Venom, Katee Sackhoff as Black Cat, Val Kilmer as Walker Sloan, Laura Vandervoort as Mary Jane Watson, and Fred Tatasciore as J. Jonah Jameson.
 
The game's gameplay and story, however, were criticized for being too linear, repetitive, and short. Critics also noted the lack of variety in enemies and environments, as well as the absence of web-swinging sections. The game was also compared unfavorably to Batman: Arkham City, which was released around the same time and featured a more open-world and dynamic gameplay. The game's sales were also disappointing, selling only 270,000 copies worldwide by November 2011.
