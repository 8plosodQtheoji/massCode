## Usage
 
To use Steinberg V-Stack 1.2, launch the application from your desktop or start menu. You will see a main window with a mixer and a rack section. The mixer has up to 200 audio channels, plus 4 group channels, each with 8 send effects, 5 insert effects, and 4 master effects.

Once you have loaded a plugin, you can edit its parameters by clicking on its name in the rack section. You can also save and load presets for each plugin.
 
To route audio signals between plugins, click on the "Routing" button at the top of the rack section. You will see a matrix that shows the input and output connections of each plugin. You can drag and drop cables between plugins to create complex signal chains. You can also use the "Auto Connect" function to automatically connect plugins in series or parallel.
 
To play your VST instruments, you will need a MIDI controller or keyboard connected to your computer. You can assign each instrument to a MIDI channel by clicking on its name in the rack section and choosing "MIDI Channel" from the menu.
