# Sniper: Ghost Warrior - A Thrilling Shooter Game with a Flawed Execution
 
Sniper: Ghost Warrior is a first-person shooter game that puts you in the role of an elite sniper who has to infiltrate enemy territory and complete various missions. The game was developed by City Interactive and released in 2010 for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game received mixed reviews from critics and players, who praised its realistic sniping mechanics, but criticized its poor graphics, bugs, glitches, and linear gameplay.
 
The game features two modes: single-player and multiplayer. In single-player mode, you can choose from four difficulty levels and follow a story campaign that spans 16 missions. You can also play some missions as a spotter, who assists the sniper with locating targets and providing cover fire. The missions involve objectives such as assassinating enemy leaders, rescuing hostages, sabotaging equipment, and escaping from enemy bases. The game also features a bullet cam that shows the trajectory and impact of your shots in slow motion.

In multiplayer mode, you can join online matches with up to 12 players on four maps. You can choose from three classes: sniper, assault, and scout. Each class has different weapons, abilities, and roles in the team. The game modes include deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag. The multiplayer mode was criticized for being unbalanced, laggy, and prone to hacking.
 
Sniper: Ghost Warrior is a game that tries to deliver a realistic and thrilling sniping experience, but fails to do so due to its technical and design flaws. The game has potential, but it is overshadowed by its many problems that make it frustrating and disappointing to play. If you are looking for a better sniping game, you might want to check out Sniper Elite or Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 instead.

One of the main attractions of Sniper: Ghost Warrior is its realistic sniping mechanics. The game takes into account various factors that affect the accuracy and trajectory of your shots, such as wind, distance, gravity, and breathing. You have to adjust your scope and aim carefully to hit your targets. You can also use a heartbeat sensor and a binoculars to locate and mark your enemies. The game rewards you for headshots, stealth kills, and long-range shots with bonus points and achievements.
 
However, the game also suffers from many technical and design flaws that ruin the sniping experience. The game has poor graphics that look outdated and bland. The textures are low-resolution, the animations are stiff, and the environments are repetitive. The game also has many bugs and glitches that can cause crashes, freezes, and other issues. The game's AI is also very inconsistent and unrealistic. The enemies can spot you from far away or ignore you completely. They can also shoot you through walls or miss you at point-blank range.

The game's single-player mode is also very linear and scripted. The game forces you to follow a predetermined path and gives you little freedom to explore or improvise. The game also has many scripted events that can trigger regardless of your actions. For example, you might have to escape from a helicopter that will always find you no matter where you hide. The game also has many quick-time events that require you to press buttons at the right time to survive. The game's story is also very clichÃ©d and predictable, with stereotypical characters and dialogue.
