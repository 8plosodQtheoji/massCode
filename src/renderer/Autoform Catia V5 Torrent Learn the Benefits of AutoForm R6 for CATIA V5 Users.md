For example, let's create a simple sheet metal box with four walls and a flange. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new part document and name it Box.
2. Switch to the Generative Sheetmetal Design workbench.
3. Create a sketch on the xy plane and draw a rectangle with dimensions 100 mm x 50 mm.
4. Exit the sketch and click on Wall icon on the toolbar. Select the sketch as the profile and click OK. A wall with default parameters is created.
5. Select one of the edges of the wall and click on Bend icon on the toolbar. Enter 90 degrees as the angle and click OK. A bend with default parameters is created.
6. Repeat step 5 for the other three edges of the wall to create four bends.
7. Select one of the faces of the box and click on Flange icon on the toolbar. Enter 10 mm as the length and click OK. A flange with default parameters is created.
8. Save your part document.

## Step 3: Simulate and Optimize the Sheet Metal Forming Process in AutoForm-ProcessDesigner for CATIA V5
 
To simulate and optimize the sheet metal forming process in AutoForm-ProcessDesigner for CATIA V5, you need to use the AutoForm workbench. You can access this workbench by clicking on Start > Shape > AutoForm. In this workbench, you can define various parameters for the simulation, such as blank shape, die geometry, process conditions, etc
