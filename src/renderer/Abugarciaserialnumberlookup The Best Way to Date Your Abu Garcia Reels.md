The reel number is usually the last set of numbers in the serial number. It tells you how many reels of that specific model were made in that year. For example, if your serial number is "1010-59-2-1-1234", then your reel is the 1234th Abu Garcia Ambassadeur 1010-59-2 baitcasting reel with a red color and a star drag that was made in 1959.
