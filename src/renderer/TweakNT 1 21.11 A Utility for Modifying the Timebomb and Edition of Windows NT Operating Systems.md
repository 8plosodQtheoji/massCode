In this article, we will show you how to use TweakNT 1 21.11 to activate Windows on a virtual machine. This is useful if you want to test different versions of Windows or run legacy software without paying for a license.
 
Before we begin, you will need to download TweakNT 1 21.11 from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsbetas/comments/ohx5hm/where_to_download_tweaknt/). You will also need a virtual machine software, such as Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 SP1, which you can download from [this website](http://vhd-vault.weebly.com/software.html).
 
## Step 1: Install Windows on your virtual machine
 
First, you need to install Windows on your virtual machine. You can choose any version of Windows from NT 4 to 10, depending on your preference and compatibility. Some versions may require a product key during installation, but you can skip this step or use a generic key.
 
After installation, Windows may ask you to activate it within a certain period of time. You can ignore this for now, as we will use TweakNT to activate it later.
 
## Step 2: Run TweakNT 1 21.11 as administrator
 
Next, you need to run TweakNT 1 21.11 as administrator on your virtual machine. To do this, right-click on the TweakNT.exe file and select "Run as administrator". You may see a warning message from your antivirus software or Windows Defender, but you can safely ignore it.

- **Reboot**: This reboots your virtual machine to apply the changes made by TweakNT.

## Step 3: Change the version and activate Windows
 
Now, you can change the version and activate Windows using TweakNT. For example, if you have installed Windows XP on your virtual machine, but you want to change it to Windows Server 2003, you can do the following:

1. Select "Windows Server 2003" from the Version drop-down menu.
2. Click on the Activate button and choose "Offline Activation".
3. Click on the Reboot button and wait for your virtual machine to restart.

After rebooting, you should see that your Windows version has changed to Windows Server 2003 and that it is activated without a product key.
 
## Conclusion
 
TweakNT is a handy tool that lets you change and activate different versions of Windows on your virtual machine. It can help you test various features and functionalities of Windows without paying for a license. However, you should only use it for educational or personal purposes, and not for commercial or illegal activities.
